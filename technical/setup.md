##Setup 

###Install Python 

####Windows 

Follow these instructions: http://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/

* You will be installing python like you would an application. Please download the newest version of Python 2 NOT Python 3. 
* Then, run what's called a SimpleHTTPServer. For Windows, type this command into their command window:
```
C:\Python27\python.exe /m SimpleHTTPServer 
```
* That should start a local server. To test this, go to your browser (Chrome is preferred and will be required for the course) and type "http://localhost:8000/" for the url. If it's working, you should see some directory listings, or at least, not see "this webpage is not available"

*Here's a helpful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5t5U0XnSew)

####Mac
* The first step is the hardest because it is a bit dependent on the computer (which model, what operating system). You likely need to download a program called XCode, which is available in the apple store. (It's free!). You can try skipping this step at first, but if you get odd error messages, you may need to go back and do it. 
You download this program, open it up, go to preferences, then go to the tab called "Downloads." Make sure you have things like "xcode" downloaded. Don't worry about the simulators.

* You're going to download something called Homebrew on to your computer. This is called a package manager. You open up the Terminal application on your computer, then copy and paste in:
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Then hit enter. That will download homebrew. If everything worked well, you'll see some emoji's for beer. 

* Now you're going to install the programming language called Python. You do this simply by entering in Terminal - brew install python

* Then go back to Terminal and type in:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
* That should start a local server. To test this, go to your browser (Chrome is preferred and will be required for the course) and type "http://localhost:8000/" for the url. If it's working, you should see some directory listings, or at least, not see "this webpage is not available"

###Text Editor
You will need some sort of text editor for today's session. I would suggest using [Sublime 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2). There are many text editors out there, so feel free to use whichever you like.
